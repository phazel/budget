# Budget

This is an app for my personal budgeting. Right now it just reads from my personal budget spreadsheet on google docs and displays a summary. It's only intended for my own use.

# Setup

*Following [this guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart). There are some dart version managers available but none seemed mature enough to use.*

```bash
brew bundle
```

- Upgrade: `brew upgrade dart`
- Switch versions: `brew switch dart 2.1.0`
